                <p>The opportunity to learn about front end web development has allowed better understanding of the languages making up

                    team. Moreover this project has served as an opportunity to refine what I want from my portfolio site and the

            <div>
                <p>When searching for UX portfolios that I liked and wanted to aspire to, I found that I leaned towards visually striking portfolios with visual personality and 
                    compelling story. Rather than relying on maximal information, I also found that I enjoyed more minimalistic portfolios with emphasis on quality of information 
                    rather than quantity. 
                </p>
                <p>During the creation of my initial portfolio and while creating my current portfolio I realized that I was providing an overwhelming amount of information but 
                    lacking quality information. In my second attempt I cut down on the information supplied and focused on design decisions. </p>

                <p>Through the CF instructions I was able to slowly build the basic HTML infrastructure for the work section, footer, and about page.  Once I started 
                    getting more comfortable with HTML I added a resume option in the navigation bar based on user feedback. </p>
                <p>During this stage I struggled with understanding how HTML was actually formatted-- initially I didn’t understand the indentation 
                    style but this was resolved by talking about it with my mentor, </p>

                <p>With CSS in specific there was a lot of trial and error in getting buttons to react in the way I wanted. Additionally, I struggled with

                    more complex features is crucial when designing and coding responsive websites. Especially now when most people use two or more 
                    devices of different sizes.

                <p>In my portfolio site JS was used exclusively to add responsive design to the navigation menu for better user experience while on a
                     mobile device.

                            is on my portfolio site. I also asked 5 personal questions to determine their relationship and comfort level with
                            technology. The tasks were followed by four questions pertaining to the difficulty and mental chatter they experienced. </p>
                        <p> Overall testers were able to navigate the site very easily. There were some issues and questions surrounding where
                            the resume is on the website so I added a link to a PDF version in different spots. Additionally, I changed “work” to “home”. </p>
